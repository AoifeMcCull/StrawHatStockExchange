# Straw Hat Stock Exchange
This is a full stack project using React, Redux, and Axios. It is a fully functioning simulated stock exchange, using fake currency, allowing users to trade peer to peer. It has limit and market order capabilities, and leaderboards for the users to compete on.
This was my capstone solo project for Prime Digital Academy.
